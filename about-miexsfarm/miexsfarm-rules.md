* You need to buy seeds before you start planting, and each seed has a different price. There will be different growth rates and yields, depending on the seed, and the time spent watering the plants will bring different values.

## **2. Watering - Fertilizer** <a href="#id-2.-watering-fertilizer" id="id-2.-watering-fertilizer"></a>

* Tree termites will have 3 growth levels. During the growth process, you need to water the plant at least three times. After each watering, the water will remain for at least one-third of the growth time. If the soil dries out, the plant will reduce its yield.
* You can use fertilizer to accelerate the plant's growth.

\+ When using fertilizer, the plant will shorten the time it takes to grow to maturity, from 3 levels down to 2 levels. Each Farner uses fertilizer and the plant will increase its maturity level by 1 level..

\+ Ensure 100% harvest output when farmers use 2 times of fertilizer for 1 plant or 3 times of watering within the prescribed time periods.

## 3. Deposit (coming soon)
