# üèµÔ∏è MiexsFarm Rules

**With the ORACLE system, players are guaranteed a profit from each type of tree they choose to buy and farm. The tokens will be balanced to the rate of USD when players buy the seeds and harvest. So players only need to care about the seed price in the shop and the seed's profit rate. No need to care about the price of the tokens.**_The information about price and profits percentage of seeds after harvest is calculated according to the following table:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="134"></th><th width="123"></th><th width="115"></th><th width="121"></th><th width="121"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Seed Name</strong></td><td><strong>Seed Color</strong></td><td><strong>Seed Price</strong></td><td><strong>Profits Percentage</strong></td><td><strong>Watering Times</strong></td><td><strong>Harvest</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Apple</td><td>Green</td><td>50 USD</td><td>7%</td><td>2</td><td>53,5 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Orange</td><td>Blue</td><td>100 USD</td><td>13%</td><td>3</td><td>113 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Pear</td><td>Yellow</td><td>60 USD</td><td>22%</td><td>5</td><td>73.2 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Cherry</td><td>Orange</td><td>200 USD</td><td>25%</td><td>6</td><td>250 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Avocado</td><td>Pink</td><td>120 USD</td><td>29.5%</td><td>7</td><td>155,4 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Chirimoya</td><td>Violet</td><td>80 USD</td><td>33.5%</td><td>8</td><td>106,8 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Cocoa</td><td>Red</td><td>500 USD</td><td>45%</td><td>10</td><td>725 USD</td></tr></tbody></table>

* After harvesting, the tokens received will be automatically added directly to the player's in-game wallet.
* When harvested, the number of tokens harvested will be balanced according to the USD exchange rate at the time of harvest. Players will receive tokens corresponding to the conversion rate.
* Depositing or withdrawing in-game tokens will incur a 2.5% transaction fee (Total 5%).
* 90% of the fee is used for buyback and burn to support the token price. 10% for the developer team and marketing activities.
* **Minimum withdrawal amount is $10/time. No maximum limit.**
* **The first withdrawal will be allowed after 24 hours from the first time login. Next time will be 1 hour after the previous withdrawal.**
* **Once the game pool is over, the growing season will end. Please wait for the next crop to continue farming.**
