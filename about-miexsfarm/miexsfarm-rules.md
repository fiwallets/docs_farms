# üèµÔ∏è MiexsFarm Rules

**With the ORACLE system, players are guaranteed a profit from each type of tree they choose to buy and farm. The tokens will be balanced to the rate of USD when players buy the seeds and harvest. So players only need to care about the seed price in the shop and the seed's profit rate. No need to care about the price of the tokens.**

## **1. Growing Time**

The information about the price and profit percentage of seeds after harvest is calculated according to the following table:

| Seed Name      | Seed Price | Selling Price | Growing Time | Revenue |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------- |

* You need to buy seeds before you start planting, and each seed has a different price. \
  There will be different growth rates and yields, depending on the seed, and the time spent watering the plants will bring different values.



## **2. Watering - Fertilizer**&#x20;

* During the growth process, you need to water the plant at least three times. After each watering, the water will remain for at least one-third of the growth time. If the soil dries out, the plant will reduce its yield.
* You can use fertilizer to accelerate the plant's growth.&#x20;

\+ When using fertilizer, the plant will shorten the time it takes to grow to maturity, from 3 levels down to 2 levels. Each Farner uses fertilizer and the plant will increase its maturity level by 1 level..&#x20;

\+ Ensure 100% harvest output when farmers use 2 times of fertilizer for 1 plant or 3 times of watering within the prescribed time periods.

## 3. Withdrawals

* **The minimum withdrawal amount is $10/time. No maximum limit.**
* **The first withdrawal will be allowed after 24 hours from the first time login. The next time will be 1 hour after the previous withdrawal.**
* **Once the game pool is over, the growing season will end. Please wait for the next crop to continue farming.**
