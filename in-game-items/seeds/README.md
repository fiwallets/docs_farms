To determine the watering milestones and harvest time for plants in the game, based on the planting time and a coefficient calculated from the growth time :

<mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">**Growth Interval (GI)**</mark> **=  Watering times \* 2 hours**

* **Growth Interval (GI)** Time for the tree to mature
* **Watering times:** This is the number of times you water your plant in a day or another watering cycle.
* The player needs to water them sufficiently every 2 hours.
