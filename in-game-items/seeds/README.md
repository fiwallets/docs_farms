Seed is one of the most important items in the farming game. They represent the resources needed to begin the process of growing and growing crops.&#x20;

Each type of seed may have its characteristics, such as growing time, yield, and commercial value.

To determine the watering milestones and harvest time for plants in the game, based on the planting time and a coefficient calculated from the growth time :

**Dis = Growing Time/3**

**Watering milestones = \[Planting Time + Dis \* 0, Planting Time + Dis \* 1, Planting Time + Dis \* 2].**

**Harvest time = Planting Time + Dis \* 2**

* "Dis" is determined by dividing the growing time by 3.
* Watering milestones are calculated by adding "Dis" to the planting time, multiplied by 0, 1, and 2.
* Harvest time is calculated by adding "Dis" to the planting time, multiplied by 2.
