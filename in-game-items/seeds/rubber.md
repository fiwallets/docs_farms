* **Economy values:** High
* **Growing period:** Rubber trees have a relatively long growing period compared to many other crops, taking approximately 19 hours to mature. It's essential to water them 3times within the specified time frame to achieve maximum productivity.
* **Origin:** Rubber trees, also known as rubber plants, typically originate from tropical and subtropical regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. These trees are primarily cultivated for harvesting latex from their bark, which is widely used in the production of tires and various other industrial applications. In the farm game, planting and managing rubber trees can potentially yield significant income for players, especially in the production and trade of rubber products.
