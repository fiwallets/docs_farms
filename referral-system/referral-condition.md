# üéØ Referral Condition

In the game, there's a VIP system where players can upgrade by meeting two specific conditions: the number of referrals and the number of NFTs at each VIP level.

1. **VIP Promotion:**
   * Players will upgrade their VIP level when they meet the following two conditions:
     * The required number of referrals (refs).
     * The required number of NFTs for each VIP level.
2. **Conditions for Referred Players:**
   * For each Referred players must purchase at least 5 seeds total and diligently cultivate.
   * For each referred player who fulfils these conditions, the referrer will receive a percentage (%) bonus from the Referral system.
3. **Benefits for Referrered Players:**
   * Referred players joining the system will receive a 1% discount on the purchase price of seed packs.
4. **Duration of Booster Benefit** üíù &#x20;

* Applicable to Newbies for the first 3 days during the initial registration period.&#x20;
* During this time, the referrer and referrer will benefit from this collaborative effort



This system creates conditions for VIP-level upgrades based on increasing participation and NFT ownership while also encouraging interaction and purchases within the community through referral bonuses and discounts.
