# ü§ù What Is The Referral System?

Along with reaching a certain number of crops, players can refer friends to play the game to reach VIP level and get extra huge bonus rewards from the in-game referral system.&#x20;

Each VIP level has different conditions and bonus rates. At the highest VIP level, players can get **up to** 5% worth of the products harvested and **up to** 15% from the number of tokens used to buy NFT of all referred players.
