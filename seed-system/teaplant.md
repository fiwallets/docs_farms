* **Economy values:** High
* **Growing period:** Teaplant trees have a long growth period and only need to be watered 3 times harvested.
* **Origin:** The tea plant, also known by its botanical name Camellia sinensis, originates from Southeast Asia, particularly countries like China, Japan, and India. This plant is primarily cultivated for the production of tea, a popular beverage enjoyed worldwide in various flavors and qualities. Harvesting and processing tea from green tea leaves require specific techniques and care to ensure high quality and distinctive flavour profiles.
